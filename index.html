                    Steve began his career as a 4th generation member of his family’s business, selling short run personalized products B-to-B via Direct Marketing.  Like his grandfather and father before him, he started in manufacturing even though his natural gifts were as a marketer.  While he quickly grasped the needs of the manufacturing environment, his real talent was to help grow the business from $10 to $30+ million of sales by focusing on product innovation and product line expansion.  When made President and tasked with selling the business, he took it to market and sold it to Taylor Corporation.  The sale process expanded Steve’s ability to look at companies from different perspectives and significantly enhanced his business acumen.

                    Glen Taylor and his team at Taylor Corporation asked Steve to stay on and run the business.  As the only family member moving forward, Steve grew Amsterdam’s sales from a little over $30 million to $100+ million in the next 6 years.  He did this by further increasing focus on product innovation and differentiation and adding a dedicated commitment to fast-paced execution.  As a result, profits grew even faster than sales.

                    <br/>
                    Because of his success, he was asked to join the Taylor Corporation Executive Team.  In any given year, as an Executive Vice President, he was responsible up to 12 of the 23 to 35 business groups that Taylor’s 80 companies which were organized around.  With a CEO’s perspective, Steve developed the ability to quickly learn a company by assessing its customer and market needs, leadership strength, technology, and execution weaknesses.  This led to creating and implementing the appropriate business model for each of the companies he supported.  Because of his strengths as a transformer, he worked with almost all the companies in the Taylor portfolio at one time or another when they needed:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A jump-start for sales growth</li>
                        <li>Turn around help</li>
                        <li>Help with assimilation of acquisitions including those purchased out of bankruptcy</li>
                        <li>An upgrade or expansion of leadership skills as they scaled</li>
                        <li>Increased execution effectiveness</li>
                    </ul>
                    Over sixteen years, Steve turned around 12 different companies and jump-started sales for dozens of others.  The diversity of Taylor Corporation’s portfolio allowed Steve to work with many different markets and manufacturing operations.  As a result, he has proven that his skills transcend market, product or service, and company size.

                    <br/>
                    After providing his talents to the Taylor portfolio, Steve began Acumen Two to help other companies with their transformational needs.
